# 📊 Impact of BTC ETF Approval on Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics

## 🎯 Overview
This research investigates the structural changes in cryptocurrency market dynamics surrounding the Bitcoin ETF approval, with a particular focus on the relationship between BTC and ETH. Our findings reveal that market behavior shifted significantly before the actual approval date, specifically around October 23, 2023, which served as a crucial breakpoint in market dynamics.

## 💡 Research Motivation
The approval of Bitcoin ETFs marks a watershed moment in cryptocurrency history, facilitating mainstream investment access. While the approval itself was significant, our research demonstrates that market adjustments began well before the official announcement. This study combines statistical analysis with news sentiment to provide a comprehensive understanding of this pivotal market transition.
